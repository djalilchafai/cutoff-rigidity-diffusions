# Gibbs measures and full support

The paper's invariant measure has density `exp (-V)`. A positive density
preserves null sets and full support. Thus continuous tensor norms that
vanish almost everywhere also vanish everywhere, as used in rigidity.
The invariance and diffusion construction are separate obligations.
