/-! # Hopf–Rinow–Cohn-Vossen: complete locally compact length spaces are proper

We only use the following weak form of the length property (`ApproxSegment`): for every pair of
points `x, y`, every `0 ≤ s ≤ dist x y` and every `η > 0` there is a point `z` with `dist x z = s`
and `dist z y ≤ dist x y - s + η`.  Under this property a complete, locally compact metric
space is proper.
